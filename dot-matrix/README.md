## Dot matrix

This project has the intent of:
- Filling two square matrices A and B of n rows by n columns, with random numbers between 0 and 100. 
- Calculate their multiplication and store the result in matrix C with the same size. 
- Use n threads to split the work to create a faster application
- There is no limitation to the number of threads
